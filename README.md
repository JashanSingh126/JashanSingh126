### Hi there 👋

<!--
I'm Jashandeep Singh, a college student from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying Computer Science and Engineering (course 6-3); currently, I am working as a software engineer for various companies, and just finished a previous research project at MIT CSAIL.

I'm extremely passionate about artificial intellgience, entreprenuership, machine learning, and software development. With my diverse background and skillset I've gained, I can provide tangible value to projects across software engineering, touching upon IOS to front-end to data science development.

If you're interested, I love setting up chats with new people who are interested to talk more, you can schedule some time with me [here](https://calendly.com/jashan-12/30min).
